# bluuit
a reddit post crawler that crams as many memes as possible
in an infinite scroll system to consume them (similar to tiktok)


i used a server to get the images, as this was designed for
when i'm in school and reddit is blocked, but not
i.redd.it, meaning i can view the images just fine
